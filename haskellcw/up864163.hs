-- if you subsitute a => Album and b => [Album]
-- it works out nicely because then foldr :: (Album -> [Album] -> [Album]) -> [Album] -> [Album] -> [Album] which fits the type signature
-- and so i made my lambda function simply check if aSales >= bSales and then swap the first Album and the second Album to keep the list in descending order
